# eXit game
eXit is the game found on the Mr Robot tv series. 
I am learning programming so the code is probably crap.

## Installation and How To Use

This section is combined because you will already be in a terminal when cloning the project:
1. Forking from github repository
2. Using command prompt (or your device's equivalent)

### Forking from Repository

In order to this click the fork button on the top right corner of the screen. Then follow this tutorial on how to set up a github project:
[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo)

### Using Command Prompt

(Note: must have `g++` compiler)

1. Put exit.cpp into a local folder of choice
2. Using command prompt navigate to the local folder with the files
3. Run the following commands:

```bash
$ g++ exit.cpp -o executable_name_here.exe
$ executable_name_here.exe
```
